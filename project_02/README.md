# Project 02: Design a PCB for Etch-a-Sketch

This repository contains the files required for the EDES 301 Project #2, including the Eagle schematic (.sch) and layout (.brd) for an Etch-a-Sketch device, the mechanical drawing of the PCB, the Bill of Materials, and manufacturing files (Gerber files). 
A detailed description of the device and a system block diagram can be found in the PowerPoint in the docs/ subfolder. The Gerber files in the MFG/ subfolder can be uploaded to manufacturing sites such as MacroFab.com to obtain quotes and order PCBs.

Acknowledgements: Thank you to Erik Welsh for designing the system block diagram and assisting in use of Eagle to design the schematic and layout.
